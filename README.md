# Checkpoint Redux

## What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, we are going to use what we have learned previously to create a ToDo Application while using Redux to manage the global state.


## Instructions

- Create  the following component:
   - Addtask
   - ListTask
   - Task
     
- Every task should have the following attributes: (ID, Description, isDone)
- The user should be:
   - Able to add a newTodo
   - Filter the tasks by (done/not)
   - Edit a task
